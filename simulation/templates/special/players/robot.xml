    <History>Formerly in the service of human civilization, robot civilization is today led by an AI that has developed its own consciousness and responds to the name Behebot. If its aversion to the human race has continued to grow over the ages, this civilization has on the other hand remained on very good terms with the local fauna, even going so far as to take on some of their physical characteristics to develop new models.</History>
