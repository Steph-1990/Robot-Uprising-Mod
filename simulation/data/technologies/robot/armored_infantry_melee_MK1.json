{
	"genericName": "Scarabot MK1",
	"description": "Intelligent Materials bestow upon Scarabots a capability for both devastating and adaptive striking power. These materials are distinguished by their integration of a high-level artificial intelligence, enabling real-time adjustments of their shape, texture, and composition. This functionality empowers the destructive members of Scarabots to optimize the damage inflicted during any interaction with a surface or material, facilitated by a prior analysis conducted before collision. It is conceivable that the intelligence of the materials may evolve akin to other automatons within the confederation.",
