	"description": "The Targeting Web represents a leading-edge technological advancement for the Arachnobots, endowing them with an unparalleled precision in target visualization. This technology operates through the meticulous acquisition and analysis of every available data, encompassing a range of variables such as aerodynamics, distance, perspective, climate, terrain, target velocity, as well as the localization of enemy energy reserves. Consequently, Arachnobots can ensnare their targets within a veritable web, from which escape is virtually impossible without incurring significant damage.",
